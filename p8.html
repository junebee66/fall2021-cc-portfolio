        <h3>
          What is "this"? | The world we see
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          You have to admit that we all have already been living in a multidimention reality for a while now.
          There is the real world, and then there's the internet world which we interact, look, and act 
          very differently than the real world. The real world can be seen as the "moment" / the "present". 
          However, the internet world is a huge repository that contains all past events and information.
          But how do we bring these together?
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Is the future a state/phase or a continuous constant| Real world Reality + Virtual World Reality
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          This camera is created with the intend to draw the vritual world on top of the existing world.
          For example, if you point your camera at an apple. The camera will be able to identify that it is an apple
          ,and it will search the api to find an image of apple, then starts drawing that image of apple on top 
          of this existing apple in the camera. Therefore, you get two versions of an apple. 
          One is what you see in real life. Another one is the possible apple from the internet. 
          Having these two visual information linking together, creates this multi-dimention phenomenal.
          It shows you all the possible apple, connecting your present (real life apple) with the future 
          (the virutal apple from internet api).

          Developing the Code | Problems Along the way

        <h2>
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/beej976/sketches/UJuZnij_R"
            >ATTEMPT 1 (Front Camera)</a
          >
        </h2>

        <p> 
          The first thing I did is to try out how to make the front camera working 
          on phones with p5 editor (this sketch will not load on laptops, only on phones).
        </p>

        <iframe
          allow="camera"
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://editor.p5js.org/beej976/sketches/UJuZnij_R"
        ></iframe>

        <h2>
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/junebee66/sketches/SchkAKzDQ"
            >ATTEMPT 2 (Google API)</a
          >
        </h2>

        <p>
          Then I tried to create a working api fetching function 
          by registering an api key and search engine ID etc.
          on google developers website.
          (API Key: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview)
          (Search Engine ID: https://cse.google.com/all)
          By changing the names in the let query = "" variable and run the code, 
          it will search an image of what the object name you put in.
          However, with the google api there is a limit of daily fetching; therefore, 
          in the final code, I change it to the giphy api, which has not fetcing limits.
        </p>

        <iframe
          allow="camera"
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://editor.p5js.org/junebee66/sketches/SchkAKzDQ"
        ></iframe>
        
        <iframe
          allow="camera"
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://editor.p5js.org/beej976/sketches/JqoERxfrH"
        ></iframe>

        <h2>
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/junebee66/sketches/2-y7-Jeim"
            >ATTEMPT 3 (Object Detection)</a
          >
        </h2>

        <p>
          Then I stumble upon the TensorFlow library COCO (Common 
          Objects in Context) which is a long-used machine-learning 
          model sponsored by Microsoft and Facebook. 
          By watching "Object Detection â€“ Webcam Tracking in p5.js/TensorFlow" by Jeff Thompson
          (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPOY2IEqUMg), I made a working code that are able to
          identify objects in cameras.

        </p>

        <iframe
          allow="camera"
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://editor.p5js.org/junebee66/sketches/2-y7-Jeim"
        ></iframe>
        
        <p>
          Then in my final project, I just combine these features together. 
          However, the drawing functions keeps messing up with the detection fucntion.
          I am trying to make them into two functions that only activates when buttons are pressed
          so they don't affect each other, but with the time limit I didn't fully get it working.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        I feel like in this semester. I have already done projects using the ideas of pixels 
        (face generator, exquisite corpse, tomorrow game...etc.). So, this time, 
        I was really digging deaeper and thinking about how do we interpret what we see in the camera.
        If all of these pixels come together has different meanings, and I absolutely enjoy practicing out coding in this way.
        I wish this can be something that I continuely develop and really get it to work!
