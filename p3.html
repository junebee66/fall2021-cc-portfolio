        (Still trouble shooting some features) In this project, I focus on the
        idea of "recording time" to "capturing time". Every second, there will
        be a new ball dropping into the space. The orange hour, green minute,
        and red second arcs act as a container to hold onto the time balls. As
        time passes on, the ball either drops out of the arcs or reamain in the
        arc baskets. By doing this, audience can see the relationships between
        every moment in time and seeing it in a wider context as a day, seeing
        time piles up and passes on.

        I went thorugh many different versions of clock to come up with this
        last one; however, the idea of piling up time and releasing it was
        always there. I had a hard time trying to make interactions between the
        balls and especially with the arcs. I want the arcs to catch the balls
        as they fall down, but they kept falling right through. I was only able
        to make them bounce back at the bottom of the box. I made a Class for
        the balls, so there can be multiples of them, but I also don't know how
        to make them bounce off each other.

        Reflection

      <p>
        I've always code in a way of trying to find how other people code for a
        similiar effect online and try to use the same logic to code mine;
        however, this time the code needs to be coherent all the way through, so
        I can't just make this up here and there. This really made me realize
        how bad of a coder I am haha. I can't bounce around different logic and
        put them all in the same code, but also I realized how hard it is to
        think of every detail of the code and still make them follow the same
        logic. I really need to practice on this.
