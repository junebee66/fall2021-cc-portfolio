          Consentful Design = Awareness + Permission

      <p>
        The two main focuses of my consentful design are awareness of personal data activity 
        and requesting for permission.

        <h3>
          Awareness | pop up boxes and "Learn More" page
        </h3>

        <p>
          In the beginning when the page first load, there will be an alert message generated by the browser, 
          letting the user know what they are going into (in advanced). 
          On the start page, a pop up box will ask the user about their preferred camera 
          and image data settings to start with. If the user disabled camera and image data access, 
          the user will be directed to a page with the options to "learn more" 
          (going to my glitch portfolio page) or to go back to the home page and change the settings. 
          If the user agreed to grant access for both the camera and image data, 
          the experimental camera will be activated and starts working. On the top of the screen, 
          there are also two signal lights that indicates current the camera and image settings/status. 
          Therefore, the user is always aware of what the program has access of and what not. 
          It is very easy to forgot what we choose as the default settings in the beginning, 
          so having this feature helps reminding the user what is happening in the back stage of the program.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Permission | executions based on consents
        </h3>

        <p>
          Once the camera starts working, the user will see two buttons on the bottom of the screen. 
          One is "Scan". Another one is "Draw". 
          Here I separated the two functions of scanning the environment's visual information taken by the camera 
          and searching the identified objects in the google's api to draw on top of the camera screen. 
          By making these two functions into their own buttons give the user the control over what the camera should execute now. 
          This way, the camera will not be constantly scanning and taking the visual data from user's environment. 
          Moreover, it will only start drawing when the user granted the permission to do so.
        </p>

          >
        </h2>

        <p>
          How I used to remember making alert and pop up boxes were all by html then style it
          with CSS. However, this time, I challenged myself to create them all in javascript.
          It was very confusing at first because I wasn't sure how can I referred to them.
          Later, I realized that I don't have to do the getdocumenbyId thing anymore. I can just
          refer the different components by their names and add a period at the end to link it
          with a function.

          >
        </h2>

        <p>
          As I was developing my code, the previous camera code started counteract with the
          new buttons code. In the end, I decided to rewrite them all in more clean logic operator.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        I enjoyed this week's practice a lot because I haven't been doing some html and css 
        related code for a while, and it feels very nice when there are thinks that can be click
        on and operate (functional) actions. Also, thinking about how to make the user be aware of
        the backstage code and what are the parts of the information he/she/they was been taking of 
        is very important. By making the scanning and drawing functions into seperate buttons
        actually help the camera functions better, not having everything working at the same time.
