          So. Finally, the world crashed, collapsed, broke down, 
          any possible way to describe “the end”. 
          However, if you (user) don’t define its end, it will never end. 
          To state it more precisely, if you don’t end it, this is where you start.

          The user is the candle character seen on the screen, 
          representing the last hope in the end of the world. 
          It will be dark. The user will be the only light source in the space. 
          The user will be traveling on the monorail through 
          the collapsed city. While following the train track, 
          the user will see the landscape of the city which is made out of broken pieces of texts. 
          The texts are generated by the most commonly searched words in the past five years from google. 
          The city represents the present.
          The goal is to create a tomorrow. 
          By clicking on the texts, the user is collecting different things 
          she/he/they want to include in the new world/tomorrow (in their bag on the bottom of the screen). 
          In the far end of the train track, the user will see pixelated images 
          that are the first image which comes up in google when searching for the text you collect.
          In the end of the game, the user will see an image of tomrrrow from their creation. 
          It will be collage image of everything the user has collected.

          Why? | Are you sure about tomorrow?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Have we always assumed a certain type of future? 
          In the past few years, we’ve witnessed the power of technology 
          but also the limits of the human body. 
          COVID happened and many of what we’ve been believing shifted 
          and what we’ve been relying on was also not solid anymore. 
          COVID is not the first unpredictable incident in history 
          and will certainly not be the last. 
          Moving forward with such unsettling uncertainty, 
          I believe there’s an underlying sense of lost in our world right now. 
          This game is created for people to re-evaluate their own attitude about the future and and create their own tomorrow .

        <p>
          Initiallly, I thought I can make this in a 3d p5.js envirnment. 
          However, I realized that the code is getting too messy if there is 2d images
          and 3d objets in the space.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        This was a tough project on a tough week (when all the midterms are going on). 
        However, this is the first time, I feel proud of myself not because I made the game working the way I want 
        (which I did not haha) but because I actaully made an organized clean code for so many complicated functions 
        in one code. I really appreciate this practice.
