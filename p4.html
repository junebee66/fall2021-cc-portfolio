          The head is my sketch. The background story is: You know that place
          between sleep and awake? That place where you still remember dreaming?
          If you can't find your way back to the awake world/reality, you will
          see him. However, he's not always him. Sometimes you might see an old
          lady with a basket full of leftover time, a mid-age men with a time
          thefting hand, or a little girl sleeping in blooming time pedals. It's
          because he's not him. He is you. The hybrid YOU with the greatest fear
          and hope. It reflects the your deepest question of what does it mean
          for you to be on HERE. But don't be afraid, he does nothing to you. He
          is just always waiting for you between the stages when you're lost and
          found.

          With the body of a motorcyclist and the feet from a happy ghost who's
          birthday is today. You can see You's face reflecting you (webcam) and
          it's always chaning just like the flower pedals spinning underneath.
          the motercuyclist is rigid and strict, he holds it together. AND
          today's is Forty, the happy ghost's birthday! There are grafetti
          everywhere celebrating this sepcial day :))

          Forty works as an accountant at a law firm. He’s super friendly but
          often is drowned in work so he doesn’t go out very much. But today is
          his birthday and he’s enjoying every minute of it. He loves balloons.
          Both the motocylist and Forty gave a very cartoony aesthetic which
          went well in the sketch. I tried to incorporate my head with a more
          sketching feeling with the circles mimicking paint brush. At the end,
          I think the final product look very interesting and unexpected.

        Reflection

      <p>
        This is the first time for me that I'm not creating generative art. I
        actually hard coded everything, and every shape. I didn't let the
        computer just generate visuals run by a logic. It is actually intesting
        for me to figure out how to code the same things more efficiently with
        variables, logics, and functions. I spent around five hours to finish
        this sketch and I think this project had really improved some of my most
        foundamental coding skills.
