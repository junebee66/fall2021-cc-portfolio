      <p>
        WARNING: There are three p5 sketches in this page. It might make your
        browser lagging a lot, sorry in andvanced! All of the sketches only work
        when you allow camera acess to your browser, so please turn it on if you
        want to see the final product. Also, if the sketch doesn't show up, try
        switching the browsers. It might work better in Safari; however, it
        varies depeding on the settings in different laptops.

        MIRROR is the central concept of my face generator. How we see ourselves
        might be extremely different than how we actually are. Drag the slider
        to the left is our past. The transparencey of the colors are mild and
        you see the the overlapping of every past self. Drag the slider to the
        right is the present. Colors are so solid that you only see the most
        recent image of self. In between the process of changing from past self
        to present, the differences you see between the pixels are your future
        self - the growth.

        I was brushing my teeth and looking at my face through the mirror.
        "small nose", "uneven cheeks", "big eyes with too much white part..." As
        I observe my facial features, I come to understand that how we see
        ourselves might be extremely different than how we actually are. Then, I
        came up with this (the following sketch). A mix of delayed captures of
        the webcam.

        Reflection

      <p>
        I felt it was important to do this face generator because our self image
        is constantly being questioned by ourselves in this mass media
        generation. We are triggered by the world and how the world present
        themselves and it leads us to doubt who we are and what we are like. I
        wish by making this, it can retrieve back the lost self esteems in all.
        The sketches definitely didn't turn out the way I want. I'm still trying
        to fix it; however, I think I learned a lot about pixels. Above are the
        two sketches that I think were closest to my original idea. I created
        those with lots of help from watching the Coding Train Youtube Channel.
